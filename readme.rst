FreeCore is a free monolithic kernel licensed under GPL-3.0.

What is FreeCore?
=================

FreeCore is an alternative kernel to Linux for those who want to build
their own operating systems without creating yet another Linux distribution.

Supported architectures:

* x86_64
* aarch64
* riscv64
* loongarch64

Building FreeCore
=================

Currently, youll need to run `make` and get the ISO/HDD from the root directory, but if you want just the kernel, navigate to `kernel/bin-x86-64/kernel`, this varies for different architectures, like `bin-aarch64`, and other.
